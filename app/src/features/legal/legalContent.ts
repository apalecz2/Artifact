/**
 * The version string recorded when a user accepts the terms. It must equal the
 * "Effective date" line in EULA.md, so the consent record names the document the
 * user was actually shown — that record is the evidence the clickwrap exists for,
 * and it is worthless if it cites a version that was never displayed. A bump also
 * invalidates older acceptances, which is what re-prompts users after a revision
 * (see eulaAcceptance.ts).
 *
 * This drifted once: the effective date moved 2026-07-20 -> 2026-07-23 while this
 * constant stayed behind, so that revision shipped without re-prompting anyone and
 * every record written pointed at a superseded document. `legalContent.test.ts`
 * now parses the date out of the bundled markdown and fails if the two disagree —
 * edit the date in EULA.md and this constant together, or the test will say so.
