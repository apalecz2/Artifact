# Compliance documents

The legal-document inventory: what exists, where each document is the source of truth,
where it is rendered, and what has to move together when one changes.

Cited from `app/vite.config.ts`, `website/vite.config.ts`,
`app/src/features/legal/legalContent.ts`, `website/src/legal/legalContent.ts`, and
`docs/release.md`. §2 is the section those comments point at.

Related: [legal-audit-2026-08-04.md](legal-audit-2026-08-04.md) — the point-in-time audit
these rules were written out of. [release.md](release.md) — Microsoft Store policy status.

## 1. The documents

| Document | Path | Governs | Versioned by |
|---|---|---|---|
| EULA / Terms of Use | `docs/legal/EULA.md` | Use of the installed app, and (§15) the website | `Effective date` line + `EULA_VERSION` |
| Privacy Policy | `docs/legal/PRIVACY.md` | App, website, and download service | `Effective date` line |
| Third-Party Notices | `NOTICES.md` | Attribution for every redistributed component | `Last regenerated` line |
| Source licence | `LICENSE` (Elastic 2.0) | The source code, not the installed app | — |
| Security policy | `SECURITY.md` | Vulnerability, AI-output, and takedown reporting | — |

`LICENSE` and the EULA cover different things and both are needed: the Elastic License
governs the source in the repo, the EULA governs the binary a user installs. The EULA says
so in its preamble, and `LICENSE` carries a closing note that third-party components are
not licensed under it.

## 2. Single source of truth

**`docs/legal/` and `NOTICES.md` are the only copies of this text in the repo.** The app,
the website, and the GitHub view all render those same files. Nothing paraphrases them.

```
docs/legal/EULA.md ──┬─→ app/src/features/legal/legalContent.ts     (?raw)  → /legal/terms
                     │                                                      → setup wizard tab
                     └─→ website/src/legal/legalContent.ts          (?raw)  → /terms
docs/legal/PRIVACY.md ─ (same two importers)                                → /legal/privacy, /privacy
NOTICES.md ──────────── (same two importers)                                → /legal/notices, /licenses
```

Both importers use Vite's `?raw` suffix and reach outside their own package root, which is
why each `vite.config.ts` sets `server.fs.allow: ['..']` — dev-server only; the production
build inlines the strings at build time, so the app works fully offline and the website
needs no runtime fetch.

Consequences worth stating plainly:

- **A Store-linked URL can never contradict what the app shows.** They are the same bytes.
- **Editing a document in one place updates every surface.** There is no second copy to
  forget.
- **Adding a legal document means adding an importer in both packages**, not copying text.

### Rendering

Privacy and the EULA go through a deliberately minimal Markdown renderer
(`app/src/features/legal/Markdown.tsx`, `website/src/legal/Markdown.tsx`) that supports
only the constructs those two documents use — no third-party Markdown dependency, which
would itself need a `NOTICES.md` entry. `NOTICES.md` contains large tables the minimal
renderer does not handle, so it renders as preformatted text: verbatim and complete, which
is what an attribution file needs anyway.

Relative cross-references between the documents (`[Privacy Policy](PRIVACY.md)`) are
rewritten per-surface by each renderer's `RELATIVE_DOC_ROUTES` map — to `#/legal/privacy`
in the app, `/privacy` on the site. A new cross-reference target needs an entry in both
maps, or the link renders as inert text.

## 3. Consent

The clickwrap lives in `app/src/features/setup/steps/TermsStep.tsx`, as a step of the setup
wizard, and is recorded by `app/src/features/legal/eulaAcceptance.ts`.

Invariants, each enforced by code or a test rather than by convention:

1. **Consent precedes any download or execution.** `SetupWizard.stepsFor` places `terms`
   ahead of `install` on every path, including the one-click automatic path, and `App.tsx`
   renders the wizard *instead of* the router until acceptance is recorded. Nothing of the
   ~3.5 GB of third-party binaries is fetched or run before the user agrees. Covered by
   `SetupWizard.dom.test.tsx` and `e2e/specs/setup.e2e.ts`.
2. **Acceptance is affirmative.** A checkbox plus a Continue click; the checkbox label
   independently restates the AI-inaccuracy disclaimer rather than relying only on
   incorporation by reference.
3. **`EULA_VERSION` equals the EULA's effective date.** The consent record has to name the
   document the user was shown. Enforced by `legalContent.test.ts`, which parses the date
   out of the bundled markdown. This drifted once (see §5).
4. **Storage failure fails closed.** If `localStorage` throws, the gate shows.
5. **The record is durable.** Acceptance is mirrored to `consent.json` in the app-data
   directory, so it survives webview storage being cleared; `localStorage` stays the fast
   path. "Remove all app data" clears both, deliberately — the wipe promises everything.

### Changing the terms

1. Edit `docs/legal/EULA.md`, including the **Effective date** line.
2. Set `EULA_VERSION` in `app/src/features/legal/legalContent.ts` to the same date.
3. Run the app tests. `legalContent.test.ts` fails if the two disagree, or if a `Section N`
   cross-reference no longer resolves after renumbering.

On the next launch every user is re-prompted, because their stored version no longer
matches. The wizard runs as a consent-only step and says the terms have changed
(`ConsentContext = 'terms-updated'`), without repeating the first-install copy that
promises nothing has been downloaded yet — which would be false on a machine that already
has the assets.

Keep the Privacy Policy's effective date equal to the EULA's when either changes: the
consent step presents both documents and records one version for the pair, and
`legalContent.test.ts` asserts the two dates match.

## 4. Attribution (`NOTICES.md`)

Regenerate whenever a dependency, a font, or a downloaded runtime component changes:

```bash
npm ls --omit=dev --all --json        # in app/    → §2
cargo metadata --format-version 1     # in app/src-tauri/ → §3
```

§3 is reconciled by **name and version** against `cargo metadata` — as of 2026-08-04, 718
rows for 718 packages, with nothing missing, nothing extra, and no licence string that
disagrees with the crate's own manifest. Reconcile that way rather than eyeballing the
table; the drift that hid there was an entire plugin's subtree.

Two traps:

- **Fonts.** `§2.1` covers Inter, Source Serif 4 (both SIL OFL 1.1) and Material Symbols
  (Apache-2.0). These are font *binaries* shipped in the installer and in the website
  build, and OFL clause 1 requires the notice and licence text to travel with them — an
  obligation the package table's format does not express, which is exactly why they went
  unlisted. Full OFL text is Appendix E.
- **Build-only tooling does not ship.** `tailwindcss` and `@tailwindcss/vite` sit in
  `dependencies`, so a production `npm ls` drags in Vite, Rollup, esbuild, LightningCSS and
  the platform-native binaries. The paragraph after the §2 table says so explicitly; don't
  list them as redistributed.

## 5. Known history

Recorded so the same drift is recognisable if it recurs.

- **`EULA_VERSION` vs effective date (fixed 2026-08-04).** Commit `0366c8d` moved the
  effective date 2026-07-20 → 2026-07-23 and introduced `EULA_VERSION` hard-coded to the
  pre-bump date in the same commit. That revision shipped without re-prompting anyone, and
  every consent record written in between cited a document that no longer existed. Now
  guarded by a test.
- **Google Fonts (fixed in the app, then on the website 2026-08-04).** Both surfaces
  `<link>`ed Inter, Source Serif 4 and Material Symbols from `fonts.googleapis.com` /
  `fonts.gstatic.com`. The app's copy was removed because it contradicted the on-device
  claim and broke offline rendering; the website's survived, sending every visitor's IP
  address and user-agent to Google while Privacy Policy §4 told them the site had no
  third-party tracking. Both are self-hosted now. **Do not reintroduce a remote font
  origin on either surface.**
- **`NOTICES.md` staleness (fixed 2026-08-04).** Adding `tauri-plugin-clipboard-manager`
  pulled in 18 crates that were never added to §3, and the three bundled fonts had never
  been listed at all — while EULA §7 and `release.md`'s Store-policy 11.2 row both asserted
  the file was complete.
